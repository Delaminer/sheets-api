# Sheets API

Make your own APIs using a simple Sheets or Excel-esque editor!

The website allows to enter your own data or CSV file, which it then uses as a database for API calls it receives.

This allows you to use your data as you would any other API without having to make and host your own server!

You can use it at [https://sheets-api-server.herokuapp.com/](https://sheets-api-server.herokuapp.com/)
